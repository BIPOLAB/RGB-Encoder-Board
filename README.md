## What is this?
This is a super-overkill rotary encoder. Not only does it encode in a rotary fashion, it also lights up! It includes a ring of 20 ultra bright and even more ultra tiny Neopixel LEDs. Ever have trouble deciding between different LED colors? Well here you don't have to. Add this to your next project to give it a brilliant flare in whatever color, or combination of colors, you want.

## How do I use it?
Check out the example code in this repo.
